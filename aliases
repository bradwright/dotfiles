# Ruby/Bundle aliases

# From http://tomafro.net/2012/06/tip-bundler-with-binstubs I don't
# want to specifically overwrite bundle, as that won't fly in
# production etc.
alias bl="bundle install --path .bundle/gems"
alias bb="bl --binstubs .bundle/bin"

alias bi="bundle install"
alias be="bundle exec"

alias headers="curl -i"
